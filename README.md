# Season-Episode-Decided

After learning some Python basics in the Fall of 2019, I decided to take a break and watch one of my favorite shows - Avatar: The Last Airbender. 
I absolutely love the series and have watched it through multiple times. However, I couldn't decide which episode or even the season I wanted to watch.
I thought that instead of making a decision for myself, I'd let my computer decide by using Python.
Using the def function in Python 3.7.3 and the random library, I was able to make a simple program that decided the season and episode I should watch.
