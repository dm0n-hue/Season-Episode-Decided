# Season-Episode-Decided

After learning some Python basics in the Fall of 2019, I decided to take a break and watch one of my favorite shows. I've seen this show before and absolutely love the series. However, I couldn't decide which episode or even the season I wanted to watch.
I then thought that instead of making a decision myself, I'll let my computer decide.
Using the def function in Python 3.7.3 and the random library, I was able to make a simple program that I felt satisfied with.
